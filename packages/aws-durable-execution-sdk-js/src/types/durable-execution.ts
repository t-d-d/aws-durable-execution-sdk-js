/**
 * A handler function type for a durable execution that provides automatic state persistence,
 * retry logic, and workflow orchestration capabilities.
 *
 * This handler type is the core interface for building stateful, long-running AWS Durable Executions
 * using the Durable Execution SDK. The handler receives a durable context that enables:
 * - Step-based execution with automatic checkpointing and replay
 * - Built-in retry strategies with exponential backoff and jitter
 * - Workflow orchestration with parallel execution and child contexts
 * - External system integration via callbacks and conditional waiting
 * - Batch operations with concurrency control
 *
 * This handler function must be wrapped by `withDurableExecution()` to enable
 * durable execution capabilities. During replay scenarios, the handler function is re-executed,
 * however the durable context operations that already completed(steps, waits, callbacks, etc.) are
 * not re-executed.
 *
 * @typeParam TEvent - The type of the input event payload (defaults to any)
 * @typeParam TResult - The type of the return value (defaults to any)
 * @typeParam TLogger - The type of a custom logger implementation (defaults to DurableLogger)
 *
 * @param event - The parsed JSON input event data for the invocation
 * @param context - The durable context providing methods for durable operations like steps,
 *                  waits, parallel execution, external callbacks, and workflow orchestration
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the handler's result value or rejects with an
 *          execution error. The result will be automatically serialized and may be
 *          checkpointed if it exceeds response size limits.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const durableHandler: DurableExecutionHandler<{ userId: string }, { status: string }> = async (event, context) => {
 *   // Execute durable step with automatic retry and checkpointing
 *   const user = await context.step("fetch-user", async () =>
 *     fetchUserFromDB(event.userId)
 *   );
 *
 *   // Wait for external callback (e.g., manual approval)
 *   const approval = await context.waitForCallback("approval", async (callbackId) => {
 *     await sendApprovalRequest(callbackId, user);
 *   });
 *
 *   // Process in parallel with concurrency control
 *   const results = await context.parallel("parallel-tasks", [
 *     async (ctx) => ctx.step("task1", () => processTask1(user)),
 *     async (ctx) => ctx.step("task2", () => processTask2(user))
 *   ]);
 *
 *   return { status: "completed" };
 * };
 *
 * export const handler = withDurableExecution(durableHandler);
 * ```
